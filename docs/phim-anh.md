Đây thực tế là một số các câu hỏi và câu trả lời liên quan đến vấn đề này

### How do people learn languages just by watching movies and read subtitles?  

They don't. They are either lying about how good they are at the language, calling understanding / repeating a few phrases 'being fluent' or they are failing to mention all the other work they've done in addition.

### Is it really true that people learn languages through movies?

Not even Children are able to learn a 2nd language from TV input alone (There are studies, but also I used my own kids as Guinea pigs).

The reason is because even though you have some visual context from things like TV, you don't get as much context and physical direction... or pantomiming... as your parents gave you when you were learning English.

Also I listened to my TL for 8-16 hours a day for YEARS and didn't pick up anything. I also traditionally studied on the side, and despite knowing grammar and a decent vocabulary I still never picked up ANYTHING from the audio I played.

It didn't matter if it was something I was familiar with or not.

The only thing that fixed that was sitting down and going line-by-line and word-by-word on TV shows and games until my brain started processing and applying everything I spent years learning.


### What should I do?

The first time watching I usually just watch without looking up words, the only exception are words or phrases that really stick out to me. Then usually I'll go back and rewatch it sometime later and that's when I'll usually do most of the looking up all the words I don't know. It also depends on how far along in learning the language you are. 

If you're a beginner I personally would say don't worry about looking up words and just get familiar with listening, if you're more intermediate then it's more beneficial to look up words because it'll help build your vocabulary. 

However, that's just my experience with learning languages through movies, everyone is a little different if you find a different way that works better for you then you should absolutely go for it.


### Some suggestions

People, myself included, often say that we learned English from movies and especially cartoons but I wouldn't categorise as "proper" learning cause it's more osmosis then thinking about what words mean. This usually works best in countries with subtitles while watching foreign movies (Sweden, Slovenia etc) cause you take it like: oh I'm watching a movie. Not: Oh I'm watching a movie I wonder if I'll understand anything.

This process of getting to know flow of the language and then even understanding words is long. I would say few years. But...

As an adult you can add movies as another tool for expanding language horizon. In my opinion there are three stages of watching movies and they all depend on current level of language knowledge.

Beginner should watch movies in target language with subtitles in his/her language. I think it's important to get the feel of the language and hear the phrases etc. and get closer to the culture of country speaking his/her target language. The important thing to note that beginner can get sensory overload if he/she starts without subtitles in native language. It might get you confused and then language can become harder, cause you think it's harder, then it should.

Beginner+ (knows I don't know 1000 words and their usage) can go a step further with using target language subtitles and first watching as is without stopping (to get the gist of the movie) and than second watching with pausing at the words you don't know and can't get the meaning out of context. And maybe writing them out in Anki or notepad to learn them separately later on.

Everybody over beginner but still learning can use your first method first without and then with target language subtitles.

For beginners reading a book with listening an audio book might be good option too. Well everybody can get lots of learning done through this process.
