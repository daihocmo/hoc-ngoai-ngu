## Definitions and Translations

The best part of the Kindle app are the quality definitions and translations that it provides if you click on a word. I don’t look up every new word because I don’t want to break the reading flow. When I’m reading in my native language, I try to learn new words from context instead of using a dictionary, so I try to emulate that process in my target language as well. Unfortunately, sometimes a word is key to understanding a paragraph or appears too freuqently to ignore. In that case I highlight the word and look at the definition. In the example below, you can see the definition isn’t visible without clicking through for the Full Definition. To save time in those cases, I resort to the translation.

Note the speaker icon next to the translation. That will pronounce the TRANSLATION, not the original word. In this example, it will say “Disugsting!” in English.

## Highlighting

As I read, I highlight every word I don’t know. Now I know I said above that I don’t look up every word because I don’t want to lose my flow. That’s true. Highlighting can be done very quickly and without much interruption, especially if you don’t try to be precise with it. I can highlight with abandon and still stay in the flow of the book.

_Your highlights provide a metric for you to assess the progress you are making in your target language. If you view your highlights, the Kindle app shows how many highlights you make per chapter. You can watch this number go down over time!_

If you want to, you can color code your highlights. You can highlight words you don’t know in one color and other items in a different color. This way you don’t have to sacrifice your usual uses of highlighting, such as marking particularly evocative passages or facts you want to remember. You can filter by color in the notes menu.


## Making Flashcards from Highlights

I designate a few minutes per day to go through my highlights and add new flashcards to my Anki deck. I don’t add every new word. I skip words such as old-fashioned slang or words that are too domain-specific to be useful. I don’t want to bloat my Anki deck with less useful words.

I don’t want my entire life to revolve around making and quizzing flashcards, so I timebox this activity. A few times a week, I set a timer for ten minutes and make as many flashcards as I can during that time. If I don’t get to all of them in that time, too bad. I don’t want to let the time I spend on flashcards interfere with the parts of language learning that I enjoy, like reading more books!

_Note that the Kindle app has its own Flashcard function. I do NOT use the Kindle flashcards. I would rather put my flashcards into Anki so that I can take advantage of its features, such as spaced repetition._

## Getting More Material Into Your Kindle App

The obvious drawback to using the Kindle app is that it is proprietary. Luckily, you can still read non-Amazon texts with the app. The Kindle app uses .MOBI files. [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) allows you to convert between types of ebook files. Once you have your file in a .MOBI format, you can [mail it to your Kindle account](https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email) to access it from the app. I also use the [Send to Kindle Chrome Extension](https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/chrome) to send longer articles and short stories to my phone so that I can take advantage of all of the language tools the Kindle offers.


## What I think could be better while reading on Kindle e-readers

Reading has been an incredible way for me to improve my English level. Kindle e-readers are awesome to read on when it comes to learning a new language, because you can look up the definition / meaning of a word just with a simple touch. What's more, the Kindle e-readers have a built-in vocabulary builder that's supposed to help you retain the words you looked up.

However, I don't think the built-in vocabulary reader is enough for people wanting to learn in earnest, for several reasons:

- no proper SRS
- no ability to shadow
- can't create custom flashcards
- no possible to study on other support
- limit in the number of words (about 2000) you can look up before older ones are deleted
- ...

I know multiple tools exist that try to solve some of those pain points, such as:

- [Kindle Mate](http://kmate.me/): No longer maintained, only works on Windows, no built-in SRS.
- [Fluent Cards](https://fluentcards.com/): Only exports lookups to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
- ... and several other small tools

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in a tool that would try and solve the problems I mentioned above, and more.

I've set up a [landing page](https://kindlevocabulary.com/) with what I had in mind and would love to get your thoughts.

When I read on Kindle I highlight the sentence of words I look up, then export a file of the highlights. Then I pull that into Google sheets template I have set up which adds a column with a deepL translation of the sentence. I then import that into Anki.

Obviously from the description it's not the most seemless set up, but it also takes about 4 minutes start to finish and allows me to customize exactly which sentence/clause I'm putting on my cards. But yeah, to answer your question, if you can make something that's better than my current system, I'd probably use it
