## Beginner's Guide

For Anki beginners, habit & friction is your enemy. Maintaining a daily routine is critical. Read the Beginner's Section below and visit after:

1. you've maintained Anki for 21 days
2. have more than a hundred cards

I'm not saying beginners to stop reading this guide ... just the rest can be a little overwhelming.

### Adding Cards

- Most Anki beginners quit. You'll only keep a Anki routine if you quickly see benefits. Focus on adding work or study related cards for an immediate benefit.
- Use a computer to add cards to Anki. It is hard to add cards on mobile.
- In the beginning, try not to add more than twenty cards a day. It's very easy to desire to "remember everything" and find yourself overwhelmed.
- Add simple cards.

### Reviewing Cards

- Download (and review using) the mobile apps. This is probably the most important tip.

- **The [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=en) (free) version is amazing!** There is also a [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387) ($25).
- Keep a daily habit to review all your cards. In the beginning, reviewing take two to four minutes. It's easy to skip and then catch up, but having a routine will be critical later.
- Aim to make reviewing Anki as easy as possible.

## General Guide

### Card Types

Anki comes with three default card types:

- Basic Type (shoutout to [Bunny_Wabit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bunny_Wabbit) for more clarification)

![Basic Anki Card](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/a0WFgAA5Tqat0P3Ng5kj.png)

- Basic + Reversed Type. Similar to Basic, except both sides of the Card are used to quiz your knowledge.

- Cloze Card Type

![Cloze Card Type](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/this_is_cloze_derived.gif)

Card Types have have certain advantages based on categories and user preferences.

- You can change the prompts of a cloze card by modifying c1, c2, etc.

![Cloze Card Example](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/hWJ38eZjR46LQdqKIQ6J.png)

- Some plugins add Custom Card Types like Image Occlusion (Also referred as graphic deletion). Great for anatomy.

- I prefer creating cloze cards. Proper cloze cards add meaningful context and improve fundamental understanding. Takes slightly more time to add.
- You can also make custom card types.

### Categories and Recommended Card Types

|**Category**|**Recommend Card Type**|**Why**|
|---|---|---|
|General|Basic + Reversed|Avoid tip-of-the-tongue issues.|
|Screenshots from Video Tutorials (YouTube, etc)|Basic|It's hard to format screenshots to fit front-and-back or cloze formats.|
|Code Block (Snippet)|Basic, Use Anki Code Plugin|Most code snippets are hard to format.|
|Code Block (StackOverflow Answer)|Basic, Cloze|Most code snippets are hard to format to fit basic-and-reversed. I frequently will just take a snapshot of the answer and paste unformatted.|
|Definitions|Basic|Basic-and-reversed can have multiple answers. Easier to make a basic card. Definitions in cloze can let the answer slip too easily.|
|Wikipedia Paragraph|Cloze|Wikipedia articles are a great way to provide context while quizzing you on key topics. Improves fundamentals.|
|Labelled Images (Human Body, Anatomy, Maps, etc)|Image Occlusion Plugin|Your brain was designed for visual memory.|
|List|Cloze|Lists are difficult to memorize on basic. Cloze cards separates a list into multiple cards.|

- Avoid adding Basic type cards. If you can make a basic card, you can probably make it a Basic + Reversed (BR) Card. BR Cards help avoid the [tip of the tongue phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip_of_the_tongue).

![Basic and Reversed](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/2chYgJqOSXaEbkjegN0U.png)

- For definitions (example: provenance), the basic+reversed type isn't helpful. I want to know a word's meaning, but trying to recall something that means "origin" has too many answers (immemorial, provenance, inception, etc).

![Basic and Reversed Card with Example](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/6PYo8PKRdqFHXDuhLumQ.png)

- Cloze cards are great for adding context to understand a topic. Most basic+reversed cards can be made into cloze cards. Over time my preferences have gone from Basic —> Basic + Reversed —> Cloze.

### Adding Cards

- Each question should have a single succinct answer.

![Who Made Anki Card](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/Uc0JeNSnT5ykvrhAC4FK.png)

- Add images. Our brains are wired visually, so this helps retention. **THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IF POSSIBLE, USE A VISUAL CUE.**

![](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/MG5zRFudQK6l9DWAyUEz.png)

- Don't add things you don't understand. Otherwise, expect frustration. The same card will be wrong multiple days, marked as a leech and a waste of time. [See Antipatterns, Useful Links]
- Most of your Anki cards should be as simple as possible.
- Add additional context for hard questions. If you get a card wrong, it's helpful to know more about the topic. I prefer adding in the extra info with cloze cards. For basic or basic + reversed cards, I'll have a succinct answer on Line 1, line breaks, Lines 3+ will be additional information.

![Complex Anki](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/lsE5yRuET0GOftafLx2m.png)

- If you have a card with multiple answers, add hints (HINT: Begins with a P...). When adding, you won't realize a question has multiple answers, but when you're reviewing, you'll know. Try to avoid this and write better questions with single answers.

![Add Hints to Anki Cards](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/Gk8XaK75QR2yWVgwi77C.png)

- Don't Add Cards Memorizing Entire Lists. Too easily forgotten. You might remember Points 1, 2, 4 today and tomorrow only remember Points 1, 2, 3.

- If necessary, use a cloze to memorize lists.
- Lists can be memorized using the loci method. [See: Learning Strategies]

![History of Deep Learning](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/15dguZUQTRFMufUHgj8w.png)

- If I added the above into a single basic card — _Q: "What are the dates and milestones of Deep Learning Ideas?" A:_ _Long forgettable list_. A cloze is a better approach. I can get one or two facts wrong and still continue with progression with the card (and without having to redo the card).

![History of Deep Learning, Cloze](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/Sk0br5OkQDiKRPi3dIeO.png)

- **Avoid importing online Anki decks. Similar to note taking, your own materials have better retention and comprehension.**
- When studying offline material, don't simultaneously create cards. Instead, highlight/circle the topics, write the Anki question you would have asked and finish studying. After the study session (or tomorrow) review your circled questions and add it to Anki. This is referred as the Cornell Notes system. [See: Studying and Learning]

- Adding cards when studying online is risky, it's too easy to end in a Wikipedia rabbit hole.
- If you've added cards, sync Anki (keyboard shortcut: Y) before leaving your house or office. Review during commute. **Make this a habit.**
- When watching online videos/lectures, I frequently create Basic cards and use screenshots as answers.

- For sites that have a detailed explanation (StackOverflow answers), I also use a screenshot instead of dealing with formatting. I'm lazy.
- A tradeoff of screenshots is they can't be easily searched.
- If you forget an Anki card (that you've already added and should know) add a similar question worded slightly differently. Spaced repetition isn't perfect, so asking the same question in a different way helps drill an answer.

- Another alternative is to add an Anki card asking "what term did you forget about when you were talking to [person]?"

![Anki Card](https://storage.googleapis.com/senrigan-public/blog/strategies-and-tips-for-anki/4s5Pciq5TqmPdxaNEs07.png)

- I don't care about grammar, formatting or spelling (apologies about some card examples ...). You shouldn't either. Only you review your cards.
- Include where you learned it. Helps links back visually. Human brains are weird. Personalizing a card helps recall.

![Anki Card](https://res.cloudinary.com/betterhealth/image/upload/c_scale,q_51,w_537/v1593045836/Blog/anki-strategies-and-tips/YrdARDQ5SYWXVh5obE3r.png)

- If you're going to paste a paragraph that uses a cloze term multiple times, use a find and replace (I like using [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to do this).
- Add names to faces. Thoughtful teachers add an entire class of student faces to names prior to the first day.
- I prefer cards in random order. Randomization helps prevent being able to recall cards only in a specific order.
