## How to start learning a foreign language

Hello and welcome to your first steps towards learning a foreign language. If you're coming here fresh to the endeavour, you've got a lot to cover, but we promise the effort will be worth the reward!

We serve as a hub to help you find all the great communities and resources that are out there

We share advice and tips that apply to all languages

When it comes to your specific language, there are lots of great places to find resources and get support. The best place to start is with the language subreddits. Check out the Resources wiki for some resources and links to language subreddits. If you'd like to know how we recommend you start learning a language, you can start with the guide below.

There's a fair amount to cover, so to make it as easy as possible one of our mods has organised everything into a guide. The guide has two formats: an online version and a PDF. The content is almost entirely the same, but the online version is updated more frequently.

## What's in the guide?

There are lots of guides out there in the internet, so why did we need another one? Most guides out there are very theoretical. They talk a lot about language learning theory or dispense a smattering of advice without covering the breadth of any one topic. Theory is important, but it can also be very lengthy. Oftentimes, the learner is still left wondering "ok great, so I think I understand how to learn, but what do I actually do to start? What resources should I use? What should my routine be?". Here we take the position that understanding the basic steps to learning a language is far more important for a beginner than dealing with lots of theory.

To help you best, the subreddit guide is structured as follows:

The start contains a bare minimum of theory, covering only the basics you really need to know before you begin.
The guide then focuses on helping you find resources. You will review the types of resources you need to start and where to find them.
The guide then helps you put everything together, covering your routine with some advice on ensuring you learn as fast as you can.

After that, the book covers more core language learning theory:

You will be shown how to use your resources optimally.
You will then cover more broad language learning theory, such as how best to learn grammar, vocabulary, and the four skills.

From there, the guide moves on to more intermediate topics, including great intermediate activities and advice for studying without a course. The end of the guide has a large set of appendices to provide additional information and respond to common queries. Beginners don't need to read this far.

If you're feeling overwhelmed by the amount of content or advice here, we recommend you just start your language. Most of us who have been here a while or started before language learning on the internet was possible had to figure out what works for ourselves, and we've done just fine. Ultimately, if you're engaging with the language and enjoying it, you are already most of the way there.

## Immersion
Immersion is probably the best approach to learning a foreign language, but also one that requires much time and effort. It is more than simply watching foreign movies or visiting particular websites. As the word itself suggests, you must be completely absorbed in the language. Therefore, your success will highly depend on how much you can dedicate yourself to it.

If you are able to live in a foreign country, for example, this approach will benefit you tremendously, since you will be forced to use the language to accomplish even the most basic tasks and, with time, this will effectively hardwire the language to your brain.

If, on the other hand, you plan on just watching a movie every now and then, then the effects of this approach will be close to negligible.

Immersion works because, given enough exposure, the brain is able to identify patterns (such as grammar) subconsciously. However in order to do that it needs constant exposure, whether that be by books, movies, or talking to native speakers, it just needs to be immersed. The more exposure you can get, the faster you will learn.

So if you are able to immerse yourself in a language, I highly recommend this approach as it is very beneficial and rewarding.

I think the only thing I could say is focus on listening and absorbing the language, don't worry so much about speaking it until you feel ready (unless the group has specific expectations for you as a participant I suppose)

This is a super specific situation though so there is probably way more you can learn from people at the event than anyone here. Ask others who speak it as a 2nd language for their advice, and gather any resources you can, be they recordings, self-published books or out of print books, whatever exists for the language. But really, just take the advice of folks around you, keep learning about the culture, and be as patient with yourself as you can. This sounds like a really special experience and opportunity

## Tips to start
I’m of the idea to start immersing as soon as possible using only content I want to immerse in (not graded readers for example)…usually within the first month of learning, but it’s all depending on your patience, motivation and plan.

Patience: when you start immersing early, you need to understand that you won’t understand much…if that makes any sense…and that per sentence you will take some time to understand parts of it and that sometimes you won’t understand all of it…and that’s ok…just move on…avoid using translation tools as you miss a lot because translations are rarely one to one

Motivation: what’s your motivation? When you start immersing early on you have to ensure you have a solid motivation….because it can be easy to get frustrated…having a solid motivation will help you get past beginning stages

Plan: don’t just start listening or reading something without understanding and call that immersion…because you will not have learned anything. You have to do what’s called comprehensible input and depending on how far your NL is from your TL, you may need to use anki to practice unknown words.

Also, depending on the differences between NL and TL, you may a need to learn pronunciation before starting to immerse. And maybe very, very basic grammar (I usually just buy a beginner grammar book and use anki to memorize beginner level grammar before starting immersion)

If the NL is very different from the TL, I typically start only reading after learning basic grammar and pronunciation…then about a year later I start listening.

With time, patience and dedication, you can get far…but keep in mind this route is not easy…not everyone can start immersing like this in a new language without quitting soon after…if you dont think this path is for you you could always do a bit more structured learning before doing immersion and then do graded reading…I just personally find that approach boring…
