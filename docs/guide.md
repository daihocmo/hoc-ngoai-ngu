## Immersion
Immersion is probably the best approach to learning a foreign language, but also one that requires much time and effort. It is more than simply watching foreign movies or visiting particular websites. As the word itself suggests, you must be completely absorbed in the language. Therefore, your success will highly depend on how much you can dedicate yourself to it.

If you are able to live in a foreign country, for example, this approach will benefit you tremendously, since you will be forced to use the language to accomplish even the most basic tasks and, with time, this will effectively hardwire the language to your brain.

If, on the other hand, you plan on just watching a movie every now and then, then the effects of this approach will be close to negligible.

Immersion works because, given enough exposure, the brain is able to identify patterns (such as grammar) subconsciously. However in order to do that it needs constant exposure, whether that be by books, movies, or talking to native speakers, it just needs to be immersed. The more exposure you can get, the faster you will learn.

So if you are able to immerse yourself in a language, I highly recommend this approach as it is very beneficial and rewarding.

I think the only thing I could say is focus on listening and absorbing the language, don't worry so much about speaking it until you feel ready (unless the group has specific expectations for you as a participant I suppose)

## Tips to start

I’m of the idea to start immersing as soon as possible using only content I want to immerse in (not graded readers for example) usually within the first month of learning, but it’s all depending on your patience, motivation and plan.

Patience: when you start immersing early, you need to understand that you won’t understand much…if that makes any sense…and that per sentence you will take some time to understand parts of it and that sometimes you won’t understand all of it…and that’s ok…just move on…avoid using translation tools as you miss a lot because translations are rarely one to one

Motivation: what’s your motivation? When you start immersing early on you have to ensure you have a solid motivation….because it can be easy to get frustrated…having a solid motivation will help you get past beginning stages

Plan: don’t just start listening or reading something without understanding and call that immersion…because you will not have learned anything. You have to do what’s called comprehensible input and depending on how far your NL is from your TL, you may need to use anki to practice unknown words.

Also, depending on the differences between NL and TL, you may a need to learn pronunciation before starting to immerse. And maybe very, very basic grammar (I usually just buy a beginner grammar book and use anki to memorize beginner level grammar before starting immersion)

If the NL is very different from the TL, I typically start only reading after learning basic grammar and pronunciation…then about a year later I start listening.

With time, patience and dedication, you can get far…but keep in mind this route is not easy…not everyone can start immersing like this in a new language without quitting soon after…if you dont think this path is for you you could always do a bit more structured learning before doing immersion and then do graded reading…I just personally find that approach boring…
