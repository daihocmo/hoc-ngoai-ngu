I think it's important to mention that your experience will probably vary greatly depending on which languages you already speak and which language you're learning.

The author talks about learning Spanish from English, two languages which share a massive amount of vocabulary. That will help massively because many words, even those less commonly used, have a good chance of being fairly transparent.

Here's a random Wikipedia exerpt in Spanish, I'm sure most non-hispanophones will manage to recognize a good chunk of the words, even if it might not be enough to get the general meaning of the sentence:

>El cuerpo cónico del saxofón le otorga propiedades más similares a las del oboe que al clarinete. El diseño más simple del saxofón es un tubo recto troncocónico y los saxofones sopranino y soprano tienen, por lo general, este diseño recto.

Now a sentence from the same article in the Gaelic version:

>Gléas aonfheag ceoil, déanta as miotal le cró leathan cónach, cosúil leis an sacschorn.

Have fun lol.

Learning by reading books once you read a basic intermediate level works well for "easier" languages such as Spanish, French, Italian or maybe even German and other relatively close languages (from the perspective of an English speaker, of course). If you try to learn a very exotic language it's probably going to be very frustrating unless you target very simple literature aimed at children.

The author acknowledges that, but then goes on to say things like:

With the reading speed of 200 words per minutes (which is comfortable enough: I tend to read English at 295 wpm, and English is far from being my native language), it would take you 150 minutes a day (2.5 hours) to process all this beauty in a year.

Then goes on to say that it's too much reading, which is true, but even beyond that you really expect to be able to real ~200wpm in a foreign language without already being at a very high level of fluency? Nonsense. My girlfriend is easily C1 in English but she still sometimes has to pause when we watch something with English subtitles so that she can catch up. When learning a language you'll probably take 15minutes to read a single page and you'll be exhausted by the end. If you can cruise at 200wpm reading in a foreign language then congrats, you're fluent. Many less educated native speakers probably read slower than that.

I personally find that in general reading newspaper articles is easier and potentially more useful if literature is just too frustrating. Newspaper articles have a few advantages for a learner:

    They're usually fairly short, it's not a big commitment
    They favor clarity and simplicity over style. No fancy turns of phrases, no obscure synonyms to avoid repetitions. They're generally written in formal but not bookish register, the same way the native speakers of the language would speak in a formal context (not true for all languages and cultures, admittedly).
    They focus on a given subject which makes it easier to guess what something means from context. In a book an author could be describing a battlefield and then suddenly talk about what the character ate for breakfast or how about how much they like Ray Charles. A news article will typically focus on a single topic.
    Similarly the focus on a single topic and the need for clarity means that the same key words are often repeated many time which helps memorization.

Reading in your target language is obviously beneficial, but it's important not to overdo it and lose motivation. If somebody is learning English I won't advise them to read Infinite Jest or Paradise Lost. I wouldn't even recommend them to read something like Harry Potter (a very common recommendation) unless they already have a decent level in the language, otherwise they'll just have to look up 30 words per page and it'll be hugely frustrating.

Also remember that learning vocab and expressions, while absolutely crucial, is not sufficient to learn to speak a language correctly. Plenty of scholars and theologians can read Classical Greek and Latin with ease but would be hard pressed to have a conversation in them.
